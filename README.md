# logisim-nand-circuit
This is the NAND gate circuit 
Explanation :

The results show that both the AND–OR circuit and the NAND-only circuit give exactly the same outputs for every possible combination of inputs A, B, and C. This means both circuits implement the same Boolean function.
Since the truth tables of the two circuits match perfectly, we can conclude that they are functionally equivalent — even though they are built using different types of logic gates.
In other words, using only NAND gates can achieve the same logical behavior as a traditional AND–OR design. This confirms that NAND gates are functionally complete, meaning they can be used to build any digital logic function.
